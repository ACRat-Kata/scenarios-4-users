# Compilation of tools, means and scenarios to increase users' cyber-sensitivity (a work in progress)

This repository is created with the goal of presenting any persons interested with different means with which to increase user awareness of modern cybersecurity threat vectors hackers would be willing to exploit.

As the threat environment WILL evolve, any suggestion made will be considered to keep this resource up to date (at least that's the goal).

## Educational vector
### Interventions :
- Presentations by the police : in some countries, France for example, the police can be invited to give a cyber-prevention course
- Professional prevention courses : Terranova
- Witness interventions : other companies have suffered cyber-attacks and their employees can be employed to present a first-hand accound of the event.
### Gouvernment resources:
- (FR) ANSSI's MOOC : https://secnumacademie.gouv.fr/
### Online courses:
- (FR) Openclassroom : https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5492081-decouvrez-lunivers-de-la-cybersecurite ;
### Crisis management exercices
- organised with a professional partner:
    - alcyconie : https://alcyconie.com/
- Large scale internal scenario

## Training during integration period:
### Present users with official guidelines during a specific cyber segment
### Demonstrate offensive tools in action
- OSINT, password cracking, badusb...
- include users in the exercice
- Be careful not to delve too far into technical demonstrations though!
- Present defensive tools (Keepass for example)

## Media vector
### Distributing cyber-security themed cartoons to employees
### YouTube channels : 
- Terranova) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmM2iEDMCBp3oC4Ott6T_hQ/videos  

### Get in contact with the advertising or communications departments and come up with pannels describing 
- tips and tricks for cyber-responsible behaviour, including simple means on how to behave in one's personal life will increase involvement.
- Simplified description of cyber-threats
- Cyber security news
- Reminders of security strategy information (password complexity rules, etc.)

## Integrate cybersecurity into company culture
- Invite the office to breakfasts when a user leaves their session open
- Organise "easter-egg hunts" around the company by installing 
    - a fake security camera
    - Raspberry pi (conneced to a network port)
    - Raspberry pi zero
    - USB stick
    - ...
- Add cyber-security advice in professional signatures of the IT department (for internal messages)
- Demonstrate professional and private use-cases of security tools

## Technical vector
### Organise phishing drills
- Employ an intern for the purpose of using his account to send out suspicious messages to colleagues (His account has been hacked and is being used as a pivot).
- Setup a email hotline to be able to get data on how efficient these drills are.
- Use malicious scripts
- Use a false internal address from a false department to issue phishing mails

**1 test every 20 days is described as an ideal rythm**
### BadUSBs
- Deposit a badUSB on the parking-lot, corridors
- use malicious scripts
### Malicious scripts
- change the desktop background
- turn on the webcam
- turn on the webcam's LED
- push the hostname and/or IP address of tricked users to a server
- send mails back to tricked users
### Red Team
- An employee acts as a hostile user, other users have to avoid being trapped by him/her
- Create a team which organises "red-team" events
- Haunt corridors looking for open user sessions
