# Compilation of tools, means and scenarios to increase users' cyber-sensitivity (a work in progress)

This repository is created with the goal of presenting any persons interested with different means with which to increase user awareness of modern cybersecurity threat vectors hackers would be willing to exploit.

As the threat environment WILL evolve, any suggestion made will be considered to keep this resource up to date (at least that's the goal).
